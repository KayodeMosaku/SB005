Old Mysql Version can use the new   driver connection?





	Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/simplilearn", "root",	"root12345");
	1. jdbc  :  I am writing JDBC Code
			Why you are Writing ?
	2. mysql :  To Connect with MySql
			How You will connect with MySql ?
	3. localhost : MySql is installed in my PC
			Where it is Running ?
	4. 3306 : It is using this port
			What is the name of MySql Data base
	5. simplilearn : is the data base name
	
		PLease provide the User/Password also
		
		1. root : User Name
		2. root12345 : This is the password I was given at the time of Installation
		
	
	
	
	Loading class `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'. This is deprecated. The new driver class is `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver'. 
	The driver is automatically registered via the SPI and manual loading of the driver class is generally unnecessary.
